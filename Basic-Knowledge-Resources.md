  >The flow of water through a hose is like the flow of electricity through a circuit. Turning the faucet increases the amount of water coming through the hose, or increases the current (amps). The diameter of the hose offers resistance to the current, determining how much water can flow. The speed of the water is equivalent to voltage. When you put your thumb over the end of the hose, you reduce the diameter of the pathway of the water. In other words, the resistance goes up. The current (that is, how much water is flowing) doesn’t change, however, so the speed of the water, or voltage, has to go up so that all the water can escape . . . As explained by the educators Dan O’Sullivan and Tom Igoe
  
  >流動的水穿過水管，就像是電力的流動穿過電路。轉開水龍頭增加通過水管的水量或者說增加電流(安培amps)。水管的直徑提供了一個對於流量的障礙(電阻Ohm)，決定了多少水可以留過去。水的速度就等於是電壓(Voltage)。當你將拇指堵住水管出口，你減少了通道的直徑。換句話說，水流的障礙增加了。水流(水通過通道的量)不變，不過，導致水的速度，或者說電壓，必須提升來讓所有的水可以噴出去...
